      Dear extraterrestrial neighbour,
      I am a universe dweller. I live on a planet called earth, which is located in the Solar System,
      Milky Way. On earth, we call our species Human (and I am one of the human species), and humans are
      the only intelligent species on our planet so far. We have a history of around 200,000 years, of
      which a year is the period of Earth orbitting the Sun (the center of Solar System). According to
      human civilization, Earth is categorized into 7 continents and 5 oceans. The human species are 
      categorized by nationality, ethnicity and language. By nationality, we have around 220 nations 
      (countries) on earth. Each country is independent with its own autonomy, army, public appearance, 
      political system (rules and regulation), economic system (trade, exchange and currency) and social 
      value (ethics and virtue). By ethnicity, human species have groups of people that have different 
      skin color. By language, we speak 6909 living language (and there are many languages that have 
      been used by our ancestors but are now not used or evolving). Some of us speak more than 1 
      language and the most used languages are Chinese, English, Spanish, Hindi and Arabic. For 
      communication, we usually convert all languages into English for people who don't know each 
      other's language, but this rule varies in different regions too (officer in Europe covert languages
      into French). To grow and thrive, human species has developed many artificial systems other than
      nature. Politics guard the fundamental ideology of a group, economics guard exchange and trade 
      of resources. Law rules and regulate any artificial system. Furthermore, advances in technology
      associate closely with civilization: the way we live, how we assume the universe and our knowledge 
      of truth. When there is great technology advances, there usually is a social, political and economic
      reform, so that the artificial systems catches up with the new level of civilization. The reform
      sometimes comes with violences, such as war in which groups of people fight with weapons. Currently,
      human species is under a peace era, and we strive to keep the peace by unifying our species. The
      most urgent problem we face, is that our activity on earth to thrive our own civilization is damaging
      our planet. The reason behind it is that our artificial systems to guard our own prosperity do not
      take
